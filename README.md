# Design
## Colour Pallet
___
The colors that are used throughout this site are taken form [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). I wanted to keep the main background of the site dark for two reasons. Its in keeping with the secret spy narritive and I found that its easier on users eyes to focus when the screen is darker.
